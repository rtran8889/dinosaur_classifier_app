# Dinosaur_Classifier_App
Hello there! This is a dinosaur image classifier app that can classify eleven different types of dinosaurs including the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex, Brachiosaurus, Pteranodon, Stegosaurus, Spinosaurus, Anklyosaurus, Allosaurus, Triceratops, Velociraptor, Parasaurolophus, and the incredibly large Mosasaurus! This is my first machine learning app! I would highly appreciate any comments or suggestions!ðŸ˜ƒ

This was made using Streamlit!
